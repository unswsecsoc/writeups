### Idea
Steganography and a substitution cipher.

### Walkthrough
Usage of the online steganography decoder [here](http://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/) results in ciphertext and a note that you're on the right track. Noting that the challenge description is a perfect pangram - that is, containing all 26 letters of the alphabet - hints that this is a substitution cipher. The ciphertext can then be decrypted using the challenge description as the key.
