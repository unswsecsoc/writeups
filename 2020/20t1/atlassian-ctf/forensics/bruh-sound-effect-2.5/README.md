### Idea
Most forensics questions involve data hidden in images, so in this one I decided to hide it in a different medium instead.

### Walkthrough
1. Put the audio file into any audio editing software (such as audacity), or audio visualising software (such as sonic visualiser) and look at the spectrogram. The spectrogram shows the flag.

### Flag
`ATLASSIAN{d3Ad_m3m3s_h1d3_414gGs}`
