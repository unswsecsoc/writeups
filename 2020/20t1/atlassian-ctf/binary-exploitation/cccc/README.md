# cccc

This is the third in a series of three beginner binary exploitation challenges (the others being `bbbb` and `cccc`).

## Flavourtext (given to players)
wait where'd my libc go

## Files

Provide these files to players:
* `cccc_patched` (challenge binary)

For internal use only:
* `cccc.c` (challenge source)
* `asdf.py` (solver script)
* `flag`
* `Makefile`
* `cccc` (original unpatched binary, as generated by `Makefile`)
* Infra:
    * `Dockerfile`
    * `docker-compose.yml`

## Solution

Yet another buffer overflow chall. This one is a ROP on a static binary with newlines banned (`gets()` will terminate on newlines).

We can easily generate a payload for this using ropper, eg:
```shell script
ropper --file cccc_patched --chain "execve cmd=/bin/sh" -b 0a
```

Just send in 62 bytes of padding + your ropchain and you'll have a shell.

## Notes

Run with `docker-compose up`.

The `docker-compose.yml` runs the chall over port 7889, but you can change this in the file (under `ports:`).
Rebuild with `docker-compose build` when you're done, and add the host and port numbers to the flavourtext and solver script.

The only difference between `cccc_patched` and `cccc` is that the final `lea` instruction in `main()` has been NOPed out to make it solvable.

This chall is probably easier than `bbbb`, so it shouldn't necessarily be released after `bbbb`.
