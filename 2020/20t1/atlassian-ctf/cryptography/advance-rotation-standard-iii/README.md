## Description
You had help for the last 2 challenges. Not for this one... Crack the ciphertext.

**Flag Format:**
The flag is similar to previous flags. It consits of a series of partially l33tsp34k encoded
english words (or acronyms) separated by '_'.

I.e. flag = `ATLASSIAN\{[A-Za-z0-9]+(_[A-Za-z0-9]+)+\}`

It is recommended to use a fast programming language / intepreter. For example, pypy will drastically speed up your solution for python.
A non-optimal solution takes on 1 core (Intel i7-6700HQ @ 3.500GHz):
```
30s    - PyPy3
3m 15s - Python3 (CPython)
```
