              <img src="/static/images/safe.jpg" />
              <p>
                It is so safe, that not even a safe-cracker can crack it in 1000 years. Using the uniquely patented SHA1 algorithm we are able to
                guarantee 160 bits of safety. Since 160 bitcoins is worth 1.5 million US dollars (May 2020), we guarantee that an attacker which
                is worth less than this will not be able to break this standard. This also means that the standard should not be used to secure
                assets that are worth more than 1.5 million US dollars.

              <h2 class="subtitle is-3">Secure</h2>
              <img src="/static/images/secure.jpg" />
              <p>
                Using agile methodologies currently only known to a select few, we blended just the right amount of memory, computer chips and network
                packets to create this standard. We publicised the final source, but not the secret ingredient in order to increase the security of our
                product. A compromise of our standard can only arise if someone was able to kidnap our developers from our underground bunker and then
                subsequently proceed to torture the secret key out of them.

              <h2 class="subtitle is-3">State of the Art</h2>
              <img src="/static/images/state-of-the-art.png" />
              <p>
                Open source and patented you say, that's what makes this standard state of the art. React.JS also used to be patented, but then Facebook
                decided that NPM had grown so fragmented and that it was depended on so much code that they unpatented it because it had become so bad.
                Our implementation is not fragmented at all since it only depends on the Python standard library.

            To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand QSWT. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of computer
            science most of the jokes will go over a typical developer's head. There's also SHA1's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven
            into its characterisation- its personal philosophy draws heavily from correctly indented Python code, for instance. The devs understand
            this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny-
            they say something deep about SECURITY. As a consequence people who dislike QSWT truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate,
            for instance, the humour in QSWT's existential catchphrase "Safe, Secure and State of the Art", which itself is a cryptic reference to WarGames.
            I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as SecSoc's genius wit unfolds
            itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them.
